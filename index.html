    <h1>My New Colour Pallete</h1>
  <br>
    <img src="images/unnamed (1).png" style="width: 400px;height: 400px;">
   
    <p>To my own analysis and the analysis of Studio binder. 
        The website gives off a look of naive with the yellow. 
        Maturity with the green.
        Calm and royal with the blue.
    </p>
    <p>The style used is analoguous which give a bit of a harmonious feeling to the website</p>
    <p>I find the combination to give off this sense of optimism, balance, and trust</p>
    <p>To develop these emtions furthur I would use a bit of a lighter blue and a tad bit darker green so they fit better together and make the emotion stronger.</p>
